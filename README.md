## **A bit more on the Research Projects which i have been part of **📖🎓

- <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3401025.3401739">ByzGame: byzantine generals game</a> Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) has gained renewed interest due to its usage as the core primitive in building consensus in blockchains. One of the primary challenges with BFT is understanding the theory behind it. Numerous BFT protocols have been proposed; unfortunately some of them have had correctness issues. We present ByzGame, a web application that uniquely connects a frontend visualization to a backend BFT implementation, and makes both BFT consensus theory and implementation more understandable. Our evaluation among two groups of students demonstrates that ByzGame can greatly increase the effectiveness in teaching and learning both fundamental and advanced topics related to BFT. 


- <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9763687">A Framework for Evaluating BFT</a> We present a framework for evaluating the performance of Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols theoretically. Our motivation is to identify protocols suitable for a particular power grid application. In this application, replicas are located in a LAN network where latency is the priority. To fully understand the performance of BFT, we provide a generic approach that quantifies the performance of BFT protocols based on the number of cryptographic operations under five different scenarios (in the presence of failures and without failures). We present the performance of three representative BFT protocols: PBFT, Prime, and SBFT. To validate our framework, we also evaluate the protocols experimentally in the CloudLab testbed. Our experimental results match the findings predicted by the framework. Although a variety of factors may affect the performance of the protocols, our framework can be used as a valuable reference to understand the performance of BFT.

- <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7887918"> FPGA implementation of Image Steganography using HAAR DWT and Modified LSB Technique</a> Security places an important role in communication applications for secure data transfers. Image Steganography is one of the most reliable technique in encryption and decryption of an image (hidden) inside other image (cover) such way that only cover image is visible. In this paper frequency domain Image Steganography using DWT and Modified LSB technique is proposed. The proposed approach uses DWT to convert spatial domain information to frequency domain information. The LL band is used for further Image Steganographic process. The image is decoded using inverse LSB. Since the LL band is used for encoding and decoding purpose, memory requirement of the design is less for hardware implementation. Also this will increase the operating frequency of the architecture. The proposed technique obtains high PSNR for both stegano and recovered hidden image.
